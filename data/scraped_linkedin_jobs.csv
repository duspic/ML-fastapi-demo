"Software Engineer, Core Product","New York, NY",Notion,https://www.linkedin.com/company/notionhq?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name,"About UsWe're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).About The RoleAs a Core Product engineer, you will directly contribute to the foundational pieces of Notion's building blocks. You will be a key player in building a robust technical foundation that allows Notion to achieve the connected workspace vision. Your work will include both internal platform contributions to accelerate other Notion engineering teams, and end-user facing functionality to enable toolmaking ubiquity. The team acts as a multiplier for the engineering organization, has outsize impact on how fast Notion grows, and guides the full-stack direction. Moreover, you will be presented with challenging technical problems as Notion’s product needs are complex. You’ll also play a key role in identifying and executing against technical investments that ensure the long-term quality, reliability, and performance of databases in Notion as we scale. You will help define team norms, operating principles, team culture, and much more.What You'll AchieveYou’ll work with a team of engineers and cross-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to define a product strategy and drive execution through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance.You’ll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion’s building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in Notion such as docs, wikis, issue tracking, project management, and more.You’ll contribute to the overall performance, reliability, and robustness of the Notion product, ensuring it scales elegantly across many dimensions.You’ll partner with engineering leaders to identify and execute against high leverage technical investment that ensure the long-term flexibility and sustainability of our core systems.Skills You'll Need To BringProven track record of execution: You have experience building world-class product experiences alongside a team of engineers.Shipping quality user interfaces: You partner closely with product and design to craft beautiful user experiences for large audiences, leveraging web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.Building the team: You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth, but also the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.Nice To HavesYou're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.

We’re not chasing shareholder value; we want to help the many people to have a better everyday life.Order Management – you might know it, or you might have no clue!
