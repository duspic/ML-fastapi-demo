Our goal is to give everyone access to an accountant who knows the user's tax situation really well and provides advice specific to their situation.We focus on a number of different tax complexities, and of those complexities, freelancers are one of our biggest customer bases. For freelancers, it's complicated to figure out which types of deductions are acceptable to the IRS. We have customizations for hundreds of different types of jobs, personalizing our tax prep for every type of freelancer. Beyond 1099 income, we support late filing, extensions, amendments, and S corps, and are continuously pushing ourselves to handle the tax scenarios that are most important to our users.User feedbackUsers love our product!

It took all the worry and confusion out of my first schedule C process and I couldn’t be more happy. Now I have to figure out what to do with all the time Keeper just saved me 😊This was the BEST tax experience I have ever had. I opened my own business this year but I had other 1099 from side hustles which made my tax process more complicated then normal. But their app made everything so easy to understand, it organised my books, it sent my tax files for free it was SO SIMPLE.This year I was inundated with forms. Freelance, dog-walking, two W-2 jobs and then some. Other tax apps couldn’t seem to keep up. I was skeptical at first, but this app is literally a godsend.

Right now, we support this situation by manually collecting information from users through email. We want to build native support into the product (1) so users can self-serve and (2) to lessen our operations burden.Chat reactions: Our chat function includes both AI and human responses - AI if the AI can confidently handle it, and human if the question exceeds the AI's capabilities.

All of your peers will be Senior Engineers with an architectural understanding of building software. This has been important due to the complexities of new and existing software.You will find the conversations you have are underpinned by deep levels of technical knowledge, curiosity and a satisfaction of learning from similar minds.Future growth will see teams grow underneath existing Engineers.You will also enjoy the company of a strong product team and together you will discover and unpack the needs, goals and frustrations of our customers in order to deliver high quality and valuable solutions that we are proud of and they love to use.Can you tell me about the leadership? Leadership largely resides in existing Developers and Designers.You will also find a very experienced technical CTO that facilitates this mindset and works on an equal footing with everyone, although naturally, with a commercial aspect to their role.Company leadership listens closely and acts on the sentiment of both customers and technology whilst looking after business direction and commercial success.How are things organised? You will be working with around 15 Engineers who are working across two different pieces of software in integration, infrastructure and software engineering.Hiring is also a collective decision by the people you talk to in the process.Who Makes Technical Decisions? Developers do this together. You're empowered not only to step up to lead, but to also step up to follow: You won't be forced to accept things the way they are, but you will need the insight and maturity to determine when best to champion ideas, or when to disagree and commit with the team.Why would I apply?

Three technical conversations. There will be technical discussions where hopefully you will feel challenged yet supported. You might be after a flexible work environment. Generous salary.
