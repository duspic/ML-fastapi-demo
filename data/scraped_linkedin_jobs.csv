Erlang is a functional programming language that originated in Ericsson in 1986. Initially, it was used there as a switching language but since then has been released as open-source which has led to wide usage for a variety of different purposes. Many clients, across a range of industries, use it due to its scalability, reliability, and ability to hot-swap. One of the main reasons for using Erlang instead of other functional languages is Erlang's ability to handle concurrency and distributed programming. By concurrency is meant programs that can handle several threads of execution at the same time. For example, modern operating systems allow you to use a word processor, a spreadsheet, a mail client, and a print job all running at the same time. Each processor (CPU) in the system is probably only handling one thread (or job) at a time, but it swaps between the jobs at such a rate that it gives the illusion of running them all at the same time. It is easy to create parallel threads of execution in an Erlang program and to allow these threads to communicate with each other. As a result, it has been an excellent tool for gaming, trading, and big data companies.Many companies have built their product in Erlang and yet very few people have even heard about it.Amazon - Used Erlang to implement SimpleDB, providing database services as a part of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). [source]Facebook - Used Erlang to power the backend of its chat service, handling more than 100 million active users [source].WhatsApp - Used Erlang to run messaging servers, achieving up to 2 million connected users per server [source].Elixir runs on the Erlang VM giving developers complete access to Erlang's ecosystem.

Engineering Manager,"Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia",Canonical,https://uk.linkedin.com/company/canonical?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name,"Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.The company is founder-led, profitable, and growing.This is a general track for first-level engineering management positions at Canonical.We believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and enterprise compute. Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable, and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of 'most software to most companies'. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding developers themselves. They should be completely at home reviewing a patch or a software design spec. They are trusted engineers who understand the importance of a whole-team effort in creating great products and who enjoy seeing colleagues develop. They should contribute code themselves to set the standard for coding, but know that the code they write is far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team's direction, focus, and delivery. We grow management skills and train engineers who are interested in soft skills to be managers.A typical first-level software engineering team is based in a single time zone, such as EMEA or Americas, or APAC, with an Engineering Manager and a Senior Engineer dedicated to a single product, who work as a team to shape the roadmap, technical strategy, code, documentation, and community engagement. They are both capable of coding, and are both leaders comfortable assigning work and maintaining expectations of delivery. They will both be expected to take management training at Canonical so they speak the same language when it comes to team behaviours, habits, routines, norms, and standards, but they focus on different sides of the problem.An Engineering Manager is responsible for line management and career guidance. The ability to develop engineering talent, to represent your team and product from a technical perspective, and to drive collaboration with other teams and customers are all critical to success in this role.We have open manager roles across a wide range of engineering domains, including:Python and GolangC / C++ / RustData infrastructureHTML / CSS / JavaScript / Typescript / ReactFlutterDistro packaging and systemsSAAS and web microservicesKernelServersGraphics, Browser and Desktop Silicon enablement and embedded devicesProduct SecurityIf your domain of expertise isn't listed above, yet you feel it's relevant to Canonical, then feel free to apply anyway.
